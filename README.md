# üß† SmartInboxer

SmartInboxer is an intelligent assistant that connects with your Gmail account to help you stay mentally organized and focused. It classifies incoming emails into user-defined categories using Large Language Models (LLMs) ‚Äî saving time and reducing mental clutter.

## üöÄ Primitive Feature

### ‚úâÔ∏è Gmail Email Categorization (MVP)

When a user receives a new email in Gmail, SmartInboxer triggers a classification pipeline:
1. **Detects new email** via Google Gmail API + Pub/Sub.
2. **Fetches email content** securely.
3. **Classifies the email** into one or more user-defined categories using an LLM (like OpenAI or Gemini).
4. **Returns the result** to the frontend, where the user can view categorized emails.
